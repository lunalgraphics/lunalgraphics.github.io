    New website is here. Not too much to say about it.
    I&#39;ve tried to revamp the website before, but there
    was always something missing. Now, using SvelteKit,
    I think I&#39;ve finally made it into something scalable
    and beautiful. <br/> <br/>
    So that&#39;s basically it. Sorry Lunal Graphics hasn&#39;t
    been releasing much new stuff lately. That pattern
    will not continue. Expect some exciting stuff this
    year! <br/> <br/>
